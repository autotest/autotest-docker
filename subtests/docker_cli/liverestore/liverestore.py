Summary
---------

Test live-restore: running container should survive docker daemon restart.

Operational Summary
----------------------

#. Run a docker container
#. Restart docker daemon
#. Verify that container is listed under 'docker ps' and is still running.

Operational Detail
------------------

Our test container outputs a string (it doesn't matter what) every
second. We check that it's running by running `docker logs` repeatedly
until we get a new line; timing out at five seconds.

We *restart* the docker daemon, not separate stop and then start.
(The latter would give us more testing options, such as confirming
continued output from the container, but there's also a lot more
possibility of leaving our system in an undefined state if something
goes wrong between stop and start.) We then check that docker still
lists the container in 'docker ps' and that the container is still
emitting output lines.

Prerequisites
-------------

This test is only applicable if docker daemon is run with --live-restore
option; we abort with TestNAError if it isn't.

live-restore also requires `KillMode=process` in the docker systemd
unit file. Without it, the container is stopped on daemon restart.
See rhbz1424709#c40 and rhbz1460266.
