# Mark this testsuite as required. This causes a special
# "required" context to be reported to GitHub on branch
# tests. The result is set to successful only if all
# testsuites marked as required are also successful. This is
# useful for integration with merge bots, so that they only
# need to watch for a single status rather than multiple
# (possibly changing) statuses. If omitted, defaults to
# false.
